 - When planning a system change, the CMDB integration can help teams analyze potential impacts by displaying dependencies between systems, applications, and infrastructure components.
 - The lifecycle of assets and CIs, such as computers, software, or network devices can be tracked within OTOBOâ€™s CMDB.
 - For recurring or complex issues, support teams can use the CMDB to view the historical data and relationships between affected CIs, assisting in identifying root causes.
 - For organizations with regulatory or compliance requirements, a CMDB provides a single source of truth for asset configurations and changes.
