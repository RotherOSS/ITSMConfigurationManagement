Summary
-------

With this documentation, you should gain a good overview of the OTOBO package “ITSMConfigurationManagement.” 
We provide a Basic Configuration based on a selection of the most commonly used Configuration Items to get you up and running quickly. If you are interested in configuring your own Configuration Items, you should be able to do so using the Advanced Configuration.

Introduction
------------

With this package, you can extend the functionality of OTOBO to manage assets and Configuration Items and link them to tickets, Customer Users, and more. This allows you to keep track of these items and have a unified solution for managing both your tickets and assets.

Common Usecases
---------------

- The lifecycle of assets and Configuration Items — such as computers, software, or network devices — can be tracked within OTOBO’s Configuration Management Database (CMDB).
- When a support agent receives an incident ticket, the CMDB enables them to view relevant Configuration Items directly associated with the affected systems or users. They can quickly check for recent changes, dependencies, and known issues.
- When planning a system change, the CMDB integration helps teams analyze potential impacts by displaying dependencies between systems, applications, and infrastructure components.
- For recurring or complex issues, support teams can leverage the CMDB to view historical data and relationships between affected Configuration Items, aiding in identifying root causes.
- For organizations with regulatory or compliance requirements, the CMDB serves as a single source of truth for asset configurations and changes.
