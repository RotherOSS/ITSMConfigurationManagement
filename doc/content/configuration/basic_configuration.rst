Basic Configuration
===================
In this section, you will learn all necessary steps to set up a basic but usable CMDB with the most commonly used Configuration Items (CIs).

Assign Agent Permissions
------------------------
Agents who need access to CIs in the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) must be assigned to the group "itsm-configitem".

Assign Customer Permissions
---------------------------
Enabling customer access to CIs requires, depending on the use case, enabling a subset or all of the following system configurations:

- *CustomerFrontend::Module###CustomerITSMConfigItem*: Enabling the config item overview for the customer interface
- *CustomerFrontend::Module###CustomerITSMConfigItemSearch*: Enabling the config item search for the customer interface
- *CustomerFrontend::Module###CustomerITSMConfigItemZoom*: Enabling the config item zoom view for the customer interface

Furthermore, at least one permission condition needs to be enabled and defined for a customer. This is done via one of the system configuration settings *Customer::ConfigItem::PermissionConditions###01* - *[...]###05*. The structure of these settings is as follows:

Name
  [required] The name displayed in the filter row of the config item overview and search view of the customer interface

Groups
  [optional] Restrict access to this permission condition to members of certain Groups

Classes
  [required] List classes which are included in this condition to filter items by

DeploymentStates
  [optional] Filter displayed CIs by deployment state

CustomerUserDynamicField
  [required] Define the name of the dynamic field holding the customer user to which the CIs are assigned

CustomerCompanyDynamicField
  [required] Define the name of the dynamic field holding the customer company to which the CIs are assigned

DynamicFieldValues
  [optional] Filter displayed CIs by one or more dynamic field values

Import the Ready to Adopt ConfigItem Classes
--------------------------------------------

.. attention::

    Importing the Ready2Import classes will create a large number of dynamic fields and is not automatically reversible. If in doubt, consider trying this on a non-productive system first.

OTOBO provides the option to import class bundles that showcase some of the most commonly used Configuration Items (CIs).  
To get started, perform the following steps:

#. Open the admin view of your OTOBO Web UI. 
#. Navigate to **Config Items** in the **CMDB Settings** section.
#. Locate the **Ready2Import Class Bundles** panel on the left side and select the class bundle you want to import.

#. Click the button to import the Ready2Adopt class bundles.
