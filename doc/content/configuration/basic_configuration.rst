Basic Configuration
===================
In this section, you will learn how to assign permissions to agents and customer users, as well as how to get started with the most commonly used Configuration Items (CIs).

Assign Permissions
------------------
Agents and customer users who need access to CIs in the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) must be assigned to the group "itsm-configitem".

Starting with the Most Commonly Used CIs
----------------------------------------
OTOBO provides the option to import class bundles that showcase some of the most commonly used Configuration Items (CIs).  
To get started, perform the following steps:

#. Open the admin view of your OTOBO Web UI.  
#. Navigate to **Config Items** in the **CMDB Settings** section.  
#. Locate the **Ready2Import Class Bundles** panel on the left side and select the class bundle you want to import.
