Basic Configuration
===================
In this section, you will learn all necessary steps to set up a basic but usable CMDB with the most commonly used Configuration Items (CIs).

Assign Agent Permissions
------------------------
Agents who need access to CIs in the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) must be assigned to the group "itsm-configitem".

Import the Ready to Adopt ConfigItem Classes
--------------------------------------------
OTOBO provides the option to import class bundles that showcase some of the most commonly used Configuration Items (CIs).  
To get started, perform the following steps:

#. Open the admin view of your OTOBO Web UI. 
#. Navigate to **Config Items** in the **CMDB Settings** section.
#. Locate the **Ready2Import Class Bundles** panel on the left side and select the class bundle you want to import.
